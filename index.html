            <p>
                If you find yourself wrestling with CSS layout, it’s likely you’re making decisions for browsers they should be making themselves.
                <br>
                Through a series of simple, composable layouts, Every Layout will teach you how to better harness the built-in algorithms that power browsers and CSS.

        <h2>Every Layout has helped thousands of developers and companies simplify CSS layout in their projects</h2>
        <p>
            Employing algorithmic layout design means doing away with <span>@media</span> breakpoints, “magic numbers”, and other hacks, to create context-independent layout components
            <br>
            Your future design systems will be more consistent, terser in code, and more malleable in the hands of your users and their devices. Every Layout is now in its 3rd edition and has helped some of the largest companies in the world achieve exactly this.

                        I can’t recommend Every Layout enough. Fantasic for all of the layouts you can use in your projects obviously, but also for how much you’ll learn about flexbox, and CSS in general.

                        Every Layout has fantastic free content, but the full price for all the materials (book, site, components) has had absurdly high ROI for me. I spent less than an hour’s consulting wages, and it’s been transformative - a gift that keeps giving. Highest possible recommendation

                        Started web development in 1997 and approached the same problems with CSS with updated solutions over the years. Even after all this time references like Every Layout from Andy and Heydon are invaluable materials for re-reading and improving.
